# Re:Vibe
*Re:Vibe* is an interactive ear training platform built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, for music students of all ages and abilities who would like to improve their ears through the exercises that Re:Vibe provides. Whether the user is taking their first steps into the world of music, or are skilled in reading music and want to improve their ability to play by ear or in an ensemble, Re:Vibe serves as a user friendly, aesthetic platform that musicians enjoy training with time after time.

The website features a welcome page, a home page holding the training platform, a page featuring tips to practice ear training, and a contact page for users to submit feedback/questions to the site owner. 

## UX

### Strategy

#### Vision

While there is certainly no shortage of comprehensive ear training websites already on the web, there are few which provide a clean, aesthetic user experience. As I myself am a musician, I have used a number of ear training websites in the past to brush up on my aural skills. However, many of the websites I have used are crammed with an abundance of large, unnecessary blocks of text content, and the colour schemes used to design the websites are visually unappealing. On top of this, the model of these platforms is more utilitarian and - for want of a better word - rather boring.

With this, the vision of Re:Vibe is to provide the user with an aesthetic and sleek learning experience, designed to minimise cognitive overload so as to maximise focus and learning retention when using the platform. Furthermore, the learning experience will be presented less like a utility, and more like a game, as it is widely documented that learning is best achieved through play.  By implementing these choices coupled with a consistent focus on UX throughout the development of the project, I hope that the end result will serve to encourage users to favour the Re:Vibe ear training platform whenever they want to hone their aural skills.

#### Site Owner Goals

1. Create a platform to inspire and pass on the owner’s experience in music to the younger generation of budding musicians.
2. To establish Re:Vibe as a trusted brand to both new and returning visitors.
3. To provide a fun, game-like learning experience that both the visitors and site owner will enjoy.
4. Provide general tips on the practice of music, and resources to inspire visitors to the website to delve deeper into the world of music.
5. Provide excellent UX to maximise visitor’s dwell time and minimise bounce rate, so as to maximise SEO and brand recognition.
6. Employ a mobile-first design, to cater to users who may be commuting or away from a desktop/laptop computer.
7. Ensure that website is responsive on all device sizes.

#### Target Audience

Potential visitors to the website could be:

1. Music students - Visitors may be studying a musical instrument, and may want to improve their recognition of pitch and chords to improve their efficiency when learning pieces of music.
2. Students preparing for an upcoming exam - as aural tests are an element of practical musical examinations, visitors may want to use the service to brush up on their aural skills for their upcoming examinations.
3. Musicians seeking to play in ensembles (particularly in the jazz idiom) - as jazz music is an art form centred around spontaneity and interplay/communication between musicians, a good foundation of aural skills is essential to a jazz musician’s repertoire.
4. Visual learners - Visitors to the website may benefit from visual indicators when learning.
5. Hobbyists who are casually interested in challenging their ears.
